			<p>Modeling the Dynamics and Vulnerabilities of Global Pasturelands to Climate Change<br>
			Pasturelands are an important and understudied part of the global agricultural system. While many studies have focused on the productivity and resiliency of croplands, there is an urgent need to improve our understanding of how global pasturelands will be affected under the combined pressures of a changing climate and increasing population in the coming decades. To address this knowledge gap, the main goal of my research is to develop an observation and modeling framework that exploits remote sensing, meteorological datasets, and land cover information to improve our capability to both monitor and manage the long-term sustainability of this globally extensive and societally critical land use. I am creating an empirical model that quantifies the spatially explicit sensitivity of global pasturelands to both short- and long-term climate variations. <br>
