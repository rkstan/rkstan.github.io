			<p><b>Mapping Continuous Fields of Bare Ground, Grass, and Woody Cover in the Southern Cone of South America using Landsat</b><br>
			<br>
			Pasture and rangelands occupy roughly 33% of all land area in South America, they are ecologically vulnerable, and provide an important source of nutrition for livestock. Higher abundance of woody vegetation and desertification in pasture and rangelands both act to decrease livestock accessibility to forage grasses and increase competition for light and nutrients. We develop remote sensing-based methods to quantify the proportional cover and transitions through time among grasses, woody plant cover, and bare ground in the Southern Cone of South America. We apply our methodology to provide a baseline characterization and improve understanding of land use change and pasture and rangeland degradation in the Southern Cone region. <br>

			<p><b>Modeling the Dynamics and Vulnerabilities of Global Pasturelands to Human Impact and Climate Variability</b><br>
			<br>
			Pasturelands are an important and understudied part of the global agricultural system. While many studies have focused on the productivity and resiliency of croplands, there is an urgent need to improve our understanding of how global pasturelands will be affected under the combined pressures of a changing climate and increasing population in the coming decades. To address this knowledge gap, the main goal of my research is to develop an observation and modeling framework that exploits remote sensing, meteorological datasets, and land cover information to improve our capability to both monitor and manage the long-term sustainability of this globally extensive and societally critical land use. I am creating an empirical model that quantifies the spatially explicit sensitivity of global pasturelands to both short- and long-term climate variations. <br>

     			<p><b>Phenology</b><br>
			<br>
			Observations of vegetation phenology at regional-to-global scales provide important information about the terrestrial carbon cycle and seasonal energy fluxes between the biosphere and the atmosphere across ecosystems and climate regimes. High temporal frequency satellite instruments such as NASAâ€™s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provide consistent measurements and are excellent platforms for regional studies of land surface phenology. This study provides a comprehensive intercomparison and interpretation of start-of-season (SOS) and end-of- season (EOS) phenology derived from MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series processed using TIMESAT and the MODIS Land Cover Dynamics Product (MCD12Q2). <br>
