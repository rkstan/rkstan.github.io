			<p> I am currently the Communications Director for <a href="http://www.bu.edu/">Boston University's</a> <a href="http://www.bu.edu/gwise/">Graduate Women in Science and Engineering</a>. <br>
			<br>
			<p> Graduate Women in Science and Engineering (GWISE) at Boston University strives to create a community to support and promote women in science, technology, engineering, and math fields. Through professional development seminars and workshops, social events, mentoring, and outreach, GWISE fosters interaction across disciplines at Boston University and connects graduate students to postdocs, faculty, and broader networks in Boston and beyond. GWISE is open to all who support our cause. As leaders of the community, GWISE works to advance university policies and programs that promote equality and foster diversity and excellence. GWISE provides resources to address challenges facing women in STEM.<br>

			<p>I was the finance officer of the <a href="https://sciencegirlsclub.wordpress.com/">The Girls Science Club</a> during 2015-2016 and the lead coordinator during the 2016-2017 school year. Currently, I am serving as the supplies officer. <br>
			<br>
			<p>The Girls Science Club is a project of GWISE. In coordination with the <a href="http://westendhouse.org/">West End House Boys and Girls Club</a>, we plan fun, hands on activities to convey scientific concepts. Our goal is to help encourage more girls, starting at a young age, to gain an understanding of these concepts and get excited about science and engineering. Our volunteers strive to be positive mentors and STEM role models for our club members, mostly girls in the elementary-school age group. By hosting fun activities and sharing our love for science, we can connect these girls to STEM in a positive manner, and hopefully inspire these girls to consider careers in STEM fields. <br>
