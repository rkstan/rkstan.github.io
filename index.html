I am a PhD Candidate at the <a href="https://www.bu.edu/earth/">Department of Earth and Environment</a> at Boston University and a member of the <a href="http://www.bu.edu/lcsc/">Land Cover and Surface Climate Group</a>.<br> I study climate variability and human transformation of the landscape, especially through agriculture. I use high performance computing, machine learning and time series analysis of remote sensing observations to characterize land use and land cover change. <img style="float: right;" src="images/IMG_20170303_114944.jpg" width="300" height="400" align="right">
