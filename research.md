## Dynamics of Global Rangelands: Modeling Vulnerabilities and Monitoring Impacts from Humans and Climate Change

Approximately 26% of Earth’s land (excluding Antarctica) is occupied by grazing systems, making them the largest non-forest land use on the planet. Grazing systems are globally extensive, heterogeneous, sensitive to climate, and managed by humans to support livestock production that provide an essential source of food in many parts of the world. My dissertation is advancing work in this area by quantifying the extent and magnitude of pastureland sensitivity to climate and degradation in the Southern Cone of South America, a region that has been at the epicenter of human land use change during the 21st century. 


My dissertation research addresses three main objectives: 

1. Determine the sensitivity of grassland cover to climate variability across different climate zones, livestock production systems, and seasons. 
2. Quantify the proportional cover and transitions through time among herbaceous cover, woody plants, and bare ground in the Southern Cone of South America. 
3. In the framework of Land Degradation Neutrality and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15, assess the proportion of pasturelands and rangelands in the Southern Cone of South America that are degraded. 

<p><b>Sensitivity of global pasturelands to climate variation</b><br>
Pasturelands are an important and understudied part of the global agricultural system. While many studies have focused on the productivity and resiliency of croplands, there is an urgent need to improve our understanding of how global pasturelands will be affected under the combined pressures of a changing climate and increasing population in the coming decades. To address this knowledge gap, the main goal of my research is to develop an observation and modeling framework that exploits remote sensing, meteorological datasets, and land cover information to improve our capability to both monitor and manage the long-term sustainability of this globally extensive and societally critical land use. We are creating an empirical model that quantifies the spatially explicit sensitivity of global pasturelands to short-term climate variations.
