### Using Multi-resolution Remote Sensing to Measure Ecosystem Sensitivity and Monitor Land Degradation in Response to Land Use and Climate Variability

*My dissertation research addressed three main objectives:* 

1. How sensitive are global pasturelands to climate?
2. How are vegetation cover and composition changing in the Southern Cone of South America? 
3. What are the extent and variability in landscape degradation in the Southern Cone of South America? 

1. <p><a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019EF001316">Sensitivity of global pasturelands to climate variation</a><br>
<p> The productivity of pastures depends on the timing and amount of rainfall they receive. In this paper, we use data on vegetation productivity, rainfall, and land use in order to determine the ability of pastures to remain unaffected by a disturbance and the time required for pastures to recover following a disturbance. In dry regions, rain from the current season, rain from the last two seasons, and vegetation productivity from the previous growing season explain nearly 70% of current season vegetation productivity. Pastures in Australia are least capable of withstanding rainfall deficits, while pastures in Latin America recover more slowly after drought compared to other regions.<br>

<b>Figure:</b> Global mean seasonal sensitivity of pasturelands: (a) resistance to drought and (b) resilience. This figure shows the model coefficients for precipitation (a) and lagged vegetation anomalies (b) for the 20 different study units. Areas in purple and blue are most sensitive to change in precipitation regimes. Note that the two scales have different ranges.
