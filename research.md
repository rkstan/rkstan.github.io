### Global studies

<p><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frsen.2022.894571/full">GLanCE project</a><br>
<p> To address the need for high-quality land cover information we are using the global record of Landsat observations to compile annual maps of global land cover from 2001 to 2020 at 30 m spatial resolution. To create these maps we use features derived from time series of Landsat imagery in combination with ancillary geospatial data and a large database of training sites to classify land cover at annual time step.<br>

<p> To characterize the effect of climate on pastureland productivity at global scale, we analyze the relationship between satellite‐derived enhanced vegetation index data from MODIS and gridded precipitation data from CHIRPS at 3‐ and 6‐month time lags. To account for the effects of different production systems, we stratify our analysis by agroecological zones and by rangeland versus mixed crop‐livestock systems. Results show that 14.5% of global pasturelands experienced statistically significant greening or browning trends over the 15‐year study period, with the majority of these locations showing greening.<br>

This figure shows the model coefficients for precipitation (a) and lagged vegetation anomalies (b) for the 20 different study units. Areas in purple and blue are most sensitive to change in precipitation regimes. Note that the two scales have different ranges.

<p>To produce temporally-dependent land cover estimates—meaning land cover is predicted over time in connected sequences as opposed to predictions made for a given time period without consideration of past land cover—we use structured learning with conditional random fields (CRFs), coupled with a land cover augmentation method to produce time series training data and bi-weekly Landsat imagery over 20 years (1999–2018) across the Southern Cone region of South America.<br>

<p>We used Landsat to map changes in the fractional cover of bare ground, woody cover, and herbaceous vegetation at annual time steps from 1999 to 2019 over APU. Using field observations and Landsat imagery, we created a spectral library representative of these three cover types. We trained a machine learning model to map annual fractional cover at 30-meter spatial resolution, and used a Bayesian change point algorithm to characterize spatial and temporal trajectories of LCLUC.<br>
	
### Methods

<p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9701288">Reconstruction of Satellite Time Series With a Dynamic Smoother</a><br>

<p>we introduce a dynamic temporal smoothing (DTS) method that reconstructs sparse and noisy signals into dense time series at regular intervals. The DTS is a weighted smoother with parameters that adjust dynamically to variation in time series and can be applied to both dense and sparse time series measurements. Because the DTS smoother we describe is specifically designed to reconstruct high-quality time series of optical imagery, it has utility for applications focused on land cover and vegetation remote sensing over long time periods at moderate spatial resolution.<br> 
	
<p><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/11/19/2201">An Empirical Assessment of the MODIS Land Cover Dynamics and TIMESAT Land Surface Phenology Algorithms</a><br>

<p>This study provides a comprehensive comparison of start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS) phenological transition dates estimated from 500 m MODIS data based on two widely used sources of such data: the TIMESAT program and the MODIS Global Land Cover Dynamics (MLCD) product. Specifically, we evaluate the impact of land cover class, criteria used to identify SOS and EOS, and fitting algorithm (local versus global) on the transition dates estimated from time series of MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI). Satellite-derived transition dates from each source are compared against each other and against SOS and EOS dates estimated from PhenoCams distributed across the Northeastern United States and Canada.<br>
