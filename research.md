<b>Dynamics of Pasturelands: Modeling Vulnerabilities and Monitoring Impacts from Humans and Climate Change<b><br>

Approximately 26% of Earthâ€™s land (excluding Antarctica) is occupied by pasturelands, making them the largest non-forest land use on the planet. Pasturelands are globally extensive, heterogeneous, sensitive to climate, and managed by humans to support livestock production, which provides an essential source of food in many parts of the world. In my dissertation, I quantify the extent and magnitude of pastureland sensitivity to climate and degradation in the Southern Cone of South America, a region that has been at the epicenter of human land use change during the 21st century.

My dissertation research addresses three main objectives: 

1. Determine the sensitivity of global pasturelands to climate variability across different climate zones, livestock production systems, and seasons. 
2. Quantify the proportional cover and transitions through time among herbaceous cover, woody plants, and bare ground in the Southern Cone of South America. 
3. In the framework of Land Degradation Neutrality and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15, assess the proportion of pasturelands in the Southern Cone of South America that are degraded.

<p> The productivity of pastures depends on the timing and amount of rainfall they receive. In this paper, we use data on vegetation productivity, rainfall, and land use in order to determine the ability of pastures to remain unaffected by a disturbance and the time required for pastures to recover following a disturbance. In dry regions, rain from the current season, rain from the last two seasons, and vegetation productivity from the previous growing season explain nearly 70% of current season vegetation productivity. Pastures in Australia are least capable of withstanding rainfall deficits, while pastures in Latin America recover more slowly after drought compared to other regions.<br>

Global mean seasonal sensitivity of pasturelands: (a) resistance to drought and (b) resilience. This figure shows the model coefficients for precipitation (a) and lagged vegetation anomalies (b) for the 20 different study units. Areas in purple and blue are most sensitive to change in precipitation regimes. Note that the two scales have different ranges.
